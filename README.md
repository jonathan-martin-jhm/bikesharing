# bikesharing

## Overview
Convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

> Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

> Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

> Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
