# bikesharing

## Overview
Convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

> Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

> Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

> Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
To have a successful bike-sharing program in Des Moines, information from the CitiBike data from NYC can be used to create a successful marketing campaign. The NYC CitiBike data showed that the most common times for bike sharing were in the morning and evening hours surrounding the typical 9-5 work schedule. The primary users of the service were males with the most common ride time lasting between 5-7 minutes. To create a bike-sharing program launch in Des Moines, I would recommend the marketing primarily target male subscribers and bikes should be available in the most population regions of the city that promote ride times of 5-7 minutes. An additional visualization for future analysis could be made to assess the best times to perform maintenance on the bikes during times of low use. A second visualization could generated to analyze the age group of the male and female subscribers that would be most likely to use the service for a enhanced marketing campaign towards those age groups.
